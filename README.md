This project focuses on performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It includes data cleaning, transformation, analytical insights, and visualizations — all implemented inside a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data and uncover insights related to:

Regional sales performance  
Category-wise product performance  
Customer buying patterns  
Revenue trends  
Discount impact on revenue  
High-value orders

Step 1: Data Cleaning

Performed the following:

Checked dataset shape & info  
Verified data types  
Checked for null values (none found)  
Removed duplicate records  
Added new calculated columns (e.g :Revenue)  

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA Operations:
Grouping by Region, Category, Customer  
Summaries using sum, mean, count  
Filtering high-value sales  
Identifying top 5 revenue orders  
Understanding distribution of numerical columns  

Step 3: Visualizations (Matplotlib)

The project includes the following charts:

Total Sales by Region
Average Sales by Category  
Top 5 Revenue Orders
Sales Distribution (Histogram)
Discount vs Revenue (Scatter Plot) 
Revenue Share by Category (Pie Chart)
Total Revenue by Region**  

Each chart helps interpret trends and patterns in the dataset.

Step 4: Key Insights

The West region generated the highest sales.  
Furniture category had the highest average order value.  
Customers showed consistent buying frequency across the dataset.  
Highest single-order revenue: ₹977
Discounts significantly reduced final revenue.
